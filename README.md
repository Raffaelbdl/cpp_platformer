# C++ Platformer

This is a learning project where I tried to learn C++ and program a simple game engine in one week.

The graphical implementation is based on [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/45MIykWJ-C4?si=PtFjnVtY0JCzrpB3). The physics implementation is my own.

This project includes 
- A graphical implementation :
    - Square for character sprite
    - WiredSquare for colliders
    
- A physical implementation :
    - Non oriented square colliders
    - Collision detection
    - Simulated gravity, with ground checking
